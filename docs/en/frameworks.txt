 Framework Integration
=======================


Pyramid
=========

Add the following lines into your .ini configuration file

.. code-block:: ini

    [app:main]
    pyramid.includes =
        # ... (other packages)
        plim.adapters.pyramid_renderer

    
    # Templates options
    # ... (a number of mako.* options)
    # file extension of plim templates (.plm by default)
    plim.file_extension = .plm


Syntax Highlighters
======================

At this moment, Plim doesn't have syntax highlighters.

But, at a starting point you can use
`Slim syntax highlighters <https://github.com/stonean/slim#syntax-highlighters>`_,
since most of Plim syntax is the same as of Slim.

Editors support
----------------


* `vim-plim <https://github.com/keitheis/vim-plim>`_ - a Plim port of `vim-slim <https://github.com/slim-template/vim-slim>`_ plugin.
