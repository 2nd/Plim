Plim
~~~~~~

Plim is a Python port of Ruby's Slim template language.


In a Nutshell
-------------

Plim is build on top of the Mako templates by exploiting its preprocessor feature.


Philosophy
----------

Application logic is for the controller but don't try to make the life
for the template designer too hard by giving him too few functionality.
